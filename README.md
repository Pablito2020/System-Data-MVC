### 🤔 What's this??

This project gets some information about the system and the application context and updates it when a button is pressed. To achieve this, I used the Model View Controller (a compound design pattern). In this project, the MVC uses the observer Pattern (twice)
and the Strategy pattern to work.

It's worth to say that this project has been created by a first year computer science student, so a lot of the code can be further optimized.

### 🛠️ Dependencies:

- The [ACM Java Task Force library](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/) for the GUI objects of the application.
