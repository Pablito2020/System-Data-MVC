### 🤔 What's this??

This project gets some information about the system and the application context and updates it when a button is pressed (using the observer pattern).

It's worth to say that this project has been created by a first year computer science student, so a lot of the code can be further optimized (in fact, the class that implements the observable behavior saves the observers inside an array, and it would be 
a better way to save them within an array list). 

### 🛠️ Dependencies:

- The [ACM Java Task Force library](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/) for the GUI objects of the application.

### 🤓 Understanding the project:

* [The Observer Pattern](documentation/ObserverPattern.md)
