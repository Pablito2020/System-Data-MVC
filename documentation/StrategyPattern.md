  Strategy Pattern
</h1>

### 🙌 Utilities of this pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.  
In this project, the strategy pattern encapsulates the algorithms of the observable object (inside the Model class), the algorithms of Model and Controller (inside the view class), and the algorithms of Model (inside the controller class).


### ❓ Prerequesites to understand the observer pattern:

- Polymorphism

- Abstraction (interfaces and abstract classes)
